# Optomechatronic-Principles-Demonstration-Device
This repo showcases my Bachelor End Project (BEP) in the Control System Technology group of the Mechanical Engineering department at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
The project is about the design of a device which visually demonstrates the concepts of mechanical sensitivities of optical components. This topic is taught in the Mechanical Engineering Master's course Opto-Mechatronics. The purpose of this device is to supplement the theoretical explanations given during lectures by letting students experience the real-life effects of the sensitivities of optical elements to errors in their position.

The design features a carriage to which the three optical components are
mounted. The carriage has two degrees of freedom: translation in X and rotation α about
the X axis. These two degrees of freedom are sufficient to demonstrate the component’s
sensitivities to lateral displacement and tilt Figure 1.3. Mounting all three optical components
on the same plane and close together allows the errors in the position of the outgoing
beams to be projected onto a screen parallel to the X Y plane. This, in turn, lets the user see
the resulting errors side by side and compare the sensitivities of the optical components.
To achieve this, Two lasers are mounted to the right of the carriage such that their beams
go through a small hole in the screen with a small angle α and β. By mounting the lasers
at an angle, the reflected beams will land on the screen rather than back onto the lasers
themselves which is preferred both for user experience and to avoid damaging the lasers.
